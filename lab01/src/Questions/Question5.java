     * For this portion of the assignment you will be writing some basic arithmetic expressions.  
     * 
     * Note: You should declare and initialize any variables as a single statement (i.e., using a single line of code)
     *
     * When you are finished, you can run the unit tests located in the Question5Test.java
     *  file to verify the correctness of your solution.
     * Note: This class does not contain a main method so you should not run this program.
     * 
     * 1) Declare an int variable with the identifier number1 and assign it an initial positive non-zero value less than 100
     * 2) Declare an int variable with the identifier number2 and assign it an initial positive non-zero value less than 100 that is not evenly divisble by number2 (i.e. if number1 is 6, number2 should not be 2)
     * 3) Declare an int variable with the identifier result1 and assign it the value of the sum of number1 and number2 (addition)
     * 4) Declare an int variable with the identifier result2 and assign it the value of the difference between number1 and number2 (subtraction)
     * 5) Declare an int variable with the identifier result3 and assign it the value of the product of number1 and number2 (multiplication)
     * 6) Declare an int variable with the identifier result4 and assign it the value of the quotient of number1 and number2 where number2 is the divisor (division)
     * 7) Declare an int variable with the identifier result5 and assign it the value of the remainder of the division of number1 by number2 (modulus)
     * 8) Declare a double variable with the identifier result6 and assign it the value of integer division of number1 by number2
     * 9) Declare a double variable with the identifier result7 and assign it the value of floating-point division of number1 by number2 (you will need to use type casting)

    // Your code goes here:

    int result3 = number1 * number2;
    int result4 = number1 / number2;
