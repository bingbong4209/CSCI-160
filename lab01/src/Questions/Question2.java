     * For this portion of the assignment you will be declaring and initializing a
     *  series of variables and constants following an exact set of instructions 
     *  indicating what data type and identifier should be used for each variable
     *  or constant. In some cases you will select a literal value of your own choosing.
     * 
     * You should declare each of the variables or constants immediately below this block comment.
     * Note: You should declare and initialize each of the variables or constants as part of
     *  the same statement (i.e., on the same line). 
     *      
     * When you are finished, you can run the unit tests located in the Question2Test.java
     *  file to verify the correctness of your solution.
     * Note: This class does not contain a main method so you should not run this program.
     *
     * 1) Declare a variable of type double with the identifier worldRecordForLongestToenails
     *     You may assign an initial value of your own choosing to this variable. 
     * 2) Declare a variable of type String with the identifier secretsOfTheUniverse
     *     Assign this variable the String literal value: It wouldn't be a "secret" if I told you.
     *     Note: Capitalization, punctuation, and spacing are important. 
     * 3) Declare a constant of type double with the identifier AVOGADROS_NUMBER
     *     Assign this constant the value 6.0221413E23
     * 4) Declare a variable of type boolean with the identifier havingFunYet
     *     You may assign an initial value of your own choosing to this variable. 
     * 5) Declare a constant of type double with the identifier MAGIC_NUMBER
     *     Assign this constant the value of the variable you created in part1 (worldRecordForLongestToenails)
     *     Note: You should not hard-code the same value.
