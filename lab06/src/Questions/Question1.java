    /*   For this Exercise, you will be writing 8 different conditional expressions in order to solve a stated problem.
    *    There are five variables being passed as arguments to this method that you will use as part of your solution:
    *       An int variable with the identifier age
    *       A String variable with the identifier personName
    *       A Student variable with the identifier aStudent
    *       Two boolean variables with the identifiers a and b
    *    
    *   1) Declare a boolean varaible with the identifier condition1 and assign it a value based on the following instructions:
    *       The value of a boolean expression involving the int variable age that evaluates to true based on the following conditions:
    *        The value of age is greater than or equal to 65.
    * 
    *   2) Declare a boolean variable with the identifier condition2 and assign it a value based on the following instructions: 
    *       The value of a boolean expression involving the String personName that evaluates to true based on the following conditions:
    *        The person's name comes before 'N' alphabetically (i.e., their names starts with A - M)
    * 
    *   3) Declare a boolean variable with the identifier condition3 and assign it a value based on the following instructions:
    *       The result of a boolean expression involving the Student variable aStudent that evaluates to true based on the following conditions:
    *        The ID of the student contains no more than 7 digits in it. 
    * 
    *   4) Declare a boolean variable with the identifier condition4 and assign it a value based on the following instructions:
    *      The result of a boolean expression involving the int variable age that evaluates to true based on the following conditions:
    *       The value of age is in the range 18 to 24 inclusive. 
    * 
    *   5) Declare a boolean variable with the identifier condition5 and assign it a value based on the following instructions:
    *      The result of a boolean expression involving the String variable personName that evaluates to true based on the following conditions:
    *       The first or last letter in the String is an 'a' regardless of case (i.e., 'A' is also valid)
    * 
    *   6) Declare a boolean variable with the identifier condition6 and assign it a value based on the following instructions:
    *      The result of a boolean expression involving the Student variable aStudent that evaluates to true based on the following conditions:
    *       The student's average grade for 3 exam scores is greater than 60. 
    * 
    *   7) Declare a boolean variable with the identifier condition7 and assign it a value based on the following instructions:
    *      The result of a boolean expression involving the Student variable aStudent and the String variable personName that evaluates to true based on the following conditions: 
    *       The combined length of personName and the student's name is less than 10 characters or greater than 20 characters. 
    *       You should exclude spaces from your calculation. 
    * 
    *   8) Declare a boolean variable with the identifier condition8 and assign it a value based on the following instructions:
    *      The result of a boolean expression involving the boolean variables a and b that models the logical implication ( -> ) operator. The expected behavior is:
    *       if both a and b are true, a -> b (i.e., a implies b) is true
    *       if a is true and b is false, a -> b (i.e., a implies b) is false
    *       if a is false, a -> b (i.e., a implies b) is true regardless of the value of b
    *
    *    HINT: It is not necessary to use any if statements to complete this part of the Lab04 assignment. 
    *    CHALLENGE: Make all of your solutions a single statement.
