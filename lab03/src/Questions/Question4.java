         * For this Question you will be using two of the prominent wrapper classes to convert String
         *  variables which represent numerical data into primitive types.
         * 
         * Additionally we will be using variables that are passed as parameters to a method.
         *  If you look immediately above these instructions you will notice what's referred to as a method header
         *  Among other things, this header specifies 2 variables of type String.
         *  These are parameters to a method and you will be using them as part of your solution.
         * 
         * Because the declaration for these variables has already been done as part of the method header,
         *  it is not necessary for you to declare any of the variables value1 or value2 that you will use below.
         * 
         * 1) Instantiate a new Scanner object to read input from the console.
         *      Note: The argument for the constructor should be System.in
